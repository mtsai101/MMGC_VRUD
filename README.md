## Video Visual Relation Detection Helpler

This repository contains some helper functions for the convenient usage of
[ImageNet-VidVRD dataset](https://xdshang.github.io/docs/imagenet-vidvrd.html)
and [VidOR dataset](https://xdshang.github.io/docs/vidor.html). 
It also contains scripts for evaluating several relevant tasks, i.e.
*video object detection* and *video relation detection*.

Please note that the enclosed *baseline* does not serve as general baseline for
those tasks. You can ignore it if you are not working with ImageNet-VidVRD dataset.

Please cite the following papers if the datasets help your research:
